# The CSS Box Model
- Each element in an HTML document can be thought of as a rectangular box 
- The standard box model describes the space an element takes up
- Each box has four edges: margin, border, padding, content edges
- Margin edge -> Border edge -> Padding edge -> Content edge
- Margin is used to set element between another element, the outlayer of the box 
- The elements you set on a smaller edge might effect how it looks when you set on a bigger edge
